# Cryptocurrency Prediction Model
WSU Spring 2025 CPT_S 315 Crypto Group Project


Cryptocurrency has gained a lot of attention over the past few years due to the potential to make substantial financial returns. However, predicting cryptocurrency prices is extremely challenging due to the nature of the market. It is extremely complex and dynamic, and we are using a machine learning-based cryptocurrency price predictor that uses historical price data, technical indicators, and spatial analysis to improve forecasting accuracy. Through our implementation of recurrent neural networks, random forest regressors, and linear regression models, we were accurately able to predict the market trends and prices of various highly traded cryptocurrencies. Our testing shows that a recurrent neural network is our best predictor for long-term market sentiments and linear regression works the best for predicting short-term next day prices.
